#<center> The High Price of Coordinates: Mapping Standard of Living Variation by Income and Education Across the US
This repository stores assets related to standard of living in the United States collected and published by Rebecca Diamond and Enrico Moretti. Diamond and Moretti's publication through <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Feml.berkeley.edu%2F~moretti%2Fconsumption.pdf&clen=1946340&chunk=true">the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER)</a> assesses U.S. standard of living of the top 50 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States by income and education classes. Their research points to vital conclusions about how  standard of living varies due to consumption patterns by means of post-tax income as well as primary and secondary educational attainments. These factors are important for understanding how impacted communities can assess their economic situations more comprehensively, while also pointing to geographic questions that can be answered through a map.

This project seeks to fill a corner in the cartography cube by Roth from MacEachren (1994) by being a fairly interactive, public-facing map that synthesizes and presents knowns as opposed to revealing more unknowns. In other words, the UI will not provide an extreme level of interactivity because it is not concerned with the task of revealing unknowns, but rather, presenting what is known in a more palpable way. Therefore, the project seeks to constrain user interactivity to a limited degree and ensures synthesis of known information can be openly peer-reviewed and reproducible through a like-minded project.
The users in mind for this project should be considered first and foremost. By utilizing front-end geoprocessing tools, mobile/desktop HTML frameworks such as Bootstrap, and an assortment of other useful tools and libraries, the project should help end users better understand insights from Diamond & Moretti's standard of living data in a comprehensive manner.
