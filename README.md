<p>Contemporary research from the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER) has shed new light on the relationship between standard of living and its intersection with geography, income, and education. This dichotomy - between American city centers and their subsequent cost of living - is crucial for understanding how consumption plays a role in measuring the economic wellbeing of society through this type of barometer.</p>
<p> Standard of living should not be confused with another, oft-cited economic phrase, <i>quality of life.</i> The former contributes to the latter, providing an objective measurement of individual behavior at a societal level. At it's most basic, standard of living is simply defined as <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/standard-of-living"><i>"the amount of money and comfort people have in a particular society."</a></i> By measuring consumption patterns in relation to income and inflation, economists have better tools at their disposal for understanding the efficacy of a particular economic policy, as well as a whole host of other factors including a more rigorous examination of poverty rates and the viability of affordable housing. Moreover, research into standard of living has led to the development of other fresh literature in the <i>decent living standard</i> (DLS), which include other metrics such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6013539/">living conditions and community engagement.</a> 
<p>By mapping data related to the standard of living, we can better understand how income class and education correlate with consumption patterns at the nationwide, metropolitan level. 

<p>This repository stores assets related to standard of living in the United States collected and published by Rebecca Diamond and Enrico Moretti. Diamond and Moretti's publication through <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Feml.berkeley.edu%2F~moretti%2Fconsumption.pdf&clen=1946340&chunk=true">the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER)</a> assesses U.S. standard of living of the top 50 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States by income and education classes. Their research points to vital conclusions about how  standard of living varies in relation to consumption patterns through post-tax income as well as primary and secondary educational attainments. These factors are important for understanding how impacted communities can assess their economic situations more comprehensively. Included within this repository are data and analysis provided by Diamond & Moretti on consumption practices within 50 of the highest populated metropolitan areas in the US.

This project seeks to fill a corner in the cartography cube by Roth from MacEachren (1994) by being a fairly interactive, public-facing map that synthesizes and presents knowns as opposed to revealing more unknowns. In other words, the UI will not provide an extreme level of interactivity because it is not concerned with the task of revealing unknowns, but rather, presenting what is known in a more palpable way. Therefore, the project seeks to constrain user interactivity to a limited degree and ensures synthesis of known information can be openly peer-reviewed and reproducible through a like-minded project..
The users in mind for this project should be considered first and foremost. By utilizing front-end geoprocessing tools, mobile/desktop HTML frameworks such as Bootstrap, and an assortment of other useful tools and libraries, the project should help end users better understand insights from Diamond & Moretti's standard of living data in a comprehensive manner.
